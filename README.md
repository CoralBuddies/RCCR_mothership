# Mothership Hackathon - Coral Challenge
For Raising Coral Costa Rica, by the Coral Buddies. Info on https://mothershipmissions.com/coralreefsos

# Collaborating

Mostly, the directory structure should be self explanatory. 

We use git (via github) for our version control. 

Things that NEVER go into git:
* data
* credentials
Things that DON'T usually go into git:
* notebooks
* models

## adding your code to the git repo
* the default branch is develop, you are not allowed to commit directly to master or develop
* if you are working on the code, create a new branch, naming convention <your name>/<feature description>
* if happy, first pull latest version of develop using `git pull origin develop` and resolve any merge conflicts
* create pull request from your branch to develop
